## Configuration Steps

These are the components I've included steps I took to configure them for this project. No need understand everything going on here, but I wanted to give a high-level overview for reference.

### Components

- Yarn: package manager (variant of npm that was created by Facebook)

- React: Front-end javascript ui library

- Webpack: Module bundler. takes care of transforming/bundling up all of our javascript code into one tidy, minified `bundle.js` file to be served to the browser.

- Babel: Javascript compiler. Javascript has a ton of active (versions)[https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp]. Not all versions are supported by all browsers. this is annoying b/c as developers we want to use the latest and greatest syntax/features. Babel takes care of compiling any javascript you write into a universally supported version of Javascript to be bundled/run on the browser.

- Prettier: Code formatter. Makes life so much better. Never lose sleep/hair over your colleagues sloppy bracket indentations ever again :).

### Steps:

- initialize yarn/npm (creates package.json)
- add react, react-dom dependencies
- add webpack, webpack-dev-server, webpack-cli
- add index.html in root and index.js in ./src (index.js handles rendering root app component to DOM)
- configure webpack.config.js
- configure .babelrc
- configure .prettierrc
